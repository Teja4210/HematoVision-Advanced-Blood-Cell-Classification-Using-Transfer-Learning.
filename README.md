My project is about Smart Sorting to transfer learning for identifying rotten fruits and vegetables

Project Description:

Smart Sorting: Transfer Learning for Identifying Rotten Fruits and Vegetables Smart Sorting is an innovative project focused on enhancing the precision and efficiency of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and adapting them to specific datasets of fruits and vegetables, this project aims to revolutionize the process of sorting and quality control in the agricultural and food industry

->Smart Sorting is a deep learning-based web application that uses Transfer Learning to identify whether fruits and vegetables are Healthy or Rotten. This solution improves sorting accuracy and reduces food waste in agriculture, supermarkets, and households.

KEY FEATURES : There are some key features for sorting the rotten from fresh iteams based of fruits and vegitables. 1.Upload fruit or vegetable images. 2.Predict the class using a trained CNN model (based on VGG16). 3.Show whether it's Good to Eat or Not. 4.Displays Prediction Confidence and Result Message. 5.Feedback for impressive or problem after the prediction

Dataset: Dataset is used for for train and validation. ->There are 29 Classes basis on (Healthy/Rotten pairs for 14 fruits/vegetables). ->Total 29,000 images i have downloaded the dataset from kaggle.com. -> As well as i have Split into: 80% Training and 20% Validation.

Technologies Used: Based on the Smart Sorting project i have used some technologies like: Python 3.9 TensorFlow / Keras Flask HTML5 + CSS3 (internal) Jupyter Notebook PIL, NumPy, OS Installation: Based on the project I have installed the Anaconda Navigator to run my code through Jupyter notebook

Install dependencies: -> pip install -r requirements.txt

Run Flask App: ->python app.py

✅ Advantages of Sorting Fruits and Vegetables

1.Improved Quality Control

2.Ensures uniform size, ripeness, and appearance.

3.Removes damaged, overripe, or diseased items, improving overall product quality.

4.Increased Market Value

5.High-grade produce fetches better prices in domestic and export markets.

6.Customer Satisfaction

7.Consumers prefer consistent and appealing produce, enhancing brand trust and loyalty.

8.Efficiency in Packaging and Transport

9.Standardized sizes and shapes make packaging more efficient, reducing space and transportation costs.

10.Reduction of Post-Harvest Losses

❌ Disadvantages of Sorting Fruits and Vegetables

1.High Initial Cost (for mechanized sorting)

2.Advanced sorting machines require significant investment and maintenance.

3.Labor Intensive (if manual)

4.Manual sorting is time-consuming and requires trained workers to maintain accuracy.

5.Potential for Damage

6.Mishandling during sorting (especially mechanical) can bruise or damage delicate produce.

7.Waste Generation

8.Produce that doesn't meet cosmetic standards is often discarded, leading to food waste despite being edible.

9.Subjectivity in Manual Sorting

10.Human sorting can be inconsistent due to fatigue, varying judgment, or lack of standardization.
